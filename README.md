This project was built in less than 24 hours for a hackathon with @jekiquin during our coding bootcamp to demonstrate the skills we learned thus far. Requirements for the hackathon are stated below:

- Use HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox & Sass for structuring and building the UI
- Use appropriate BEM naming convention
- Use DOM APIs for adding/deleting/updating the elements on your page
- Use the fundamentals of programming in Javascript to write your logic. This would entail usage of variables, control flow statements, functions, loops & DOM APIs
- Demonstrate implementation of asynchronous programming concepts like promises, callbacks, event handlers
- Pick an API from the list below for your project and apply your asynchronous programming skills to call the required API in your project
- Optional: use CSS animations, responsive design, external font libraries for a better UI
